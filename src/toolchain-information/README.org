* Introduction

  The code in this module allows storing and retrieving information
  about compilation environments such as builtin macro definitions and
  include search paths. The basic idea is to include this information
  for different compilation environments and select the appropriate
  one at runtime.

  The information is stored as Lisp code and data in files in the
  =data/toolchain-information= directory. This approach has two
  benefits:

  + No dependency on external programs or files at runtime since all
    information is loaded at compile (or load) time.

  + It is (in theory) possible to mimic various compilers and
    platforms and switch between them at runtime.

  A downside of this approach is of course the necessity to collect
  and maintain the compilation environment information. This process
  can be automated somewhat using the program in the file
  =tools-for-build/gather-toolchain-information.lisp=.
